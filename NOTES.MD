- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
to derive insights from such data or try to fit a model on such data.
Min-max normalization: Guarantees all features will have the exact same scale but does not handle outliers well.
Z-score normalization: Handles outliers, but does not produce normalized data with the exact same scale.

1-Your data doesn’t follow Normal
2-Your data follows Gaussian distribution
